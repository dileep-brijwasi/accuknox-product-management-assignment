# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 📌 Product Title:
**Container Image Vulnerability Scanner Dashboard**

---

## 🧠 Background:
Modern cloud-native applications use container images for deployment. These images often include third-party libraries that may have known vulnerabilities. Security engineers and developers must identify and remediate these vulnerabilities quickly to avoid risk.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement:
Security teams need a streamlined, scalable solution to:
- Identify which container images have vulnerabilities.
- Understand the severity of each vulnerability.
- Prioritize fixes, especially for critical and high-risk vulnerabilities.

---

## 👤 User Personas:
1. **DevSecOps Engineer** – Needs quick insights into container vulnerabilities to take prompt action.
2. **Security Analyst** – Requires detailed views and reports of vulnerabilities for compliance.
3. **Developer** – Wants to know which of their images are insecure and how to fix them.

---

## 🎯 Goals:
- Show vulnerability count per container image.
- Provide severity breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- Allow filtering and sorting based on risk levels.
- Enable easy navigation to details and recommended actions.

---

## 🧾 User Stories:
- As a user, I want to see a list of container images with vulnerability summaries.
- As a user, I want to filter images by severity (e.g., Critical).
- As a user, I want to click on an image to view detailed findings and remediations.
- As a user, I want to search for a specific image by name.

---

## 🚀 MVP Features:
1. **Dashboard View** – List of container images with summary statistics.
2. **Severity Filters** – Filter by vulnerability severity.
3. **Search Bar** – Search images by name.
4. **Detail View** – Clickable entry showing vulnerability details and fixes.

---

## 🌱 Nice-to-Have Features (Future Enhancements):
- Export reports (PDF/CSV).
- Risk scoring algorithm.
- Notifications for new critical vulnerabilities.

---

## 📈 Success Metrics:
- Time to first actionable insight (TTFAI) < 30 seconds.
- Reduction in unresolved critical vulnerabilities over time.
- User satisfaction score from feedback > 8/10.

---

## 🛠 Development Action Items:
- Set up vulnerability scanning backend (e.g., Trivy, Clair).
- Build REST API to fetch vulnerability data.
- Design UI components (Dashboard, Filters, Details Modal).
- Implement role-based access control.
